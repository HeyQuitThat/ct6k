TODO, in approximate order:
- complete feature set in ncurses emulator
 - modify reg/mem
 - breakpoints
 - disassembly window
 - help
 - live assembler
 - reset
 - load program after reset?
- "serial" I/O (polling, hacky)
- update test.asm to test as many instructions/address modes as possible
    - could publish here
- Interrupt support
- Timer interrupt?
- add assembler support for reg aliases (IP, SP, FLG)
- Qt front-end
- support live memory modification
- support live assembly
- support breakpoints
- support .ORG statement
    - multi-segment object files
    - loader for multi-segment
- support strings as static data in assembler (possible now but must be done by hand)
- linker (depends on multi-segment object files)
- non-hacky way to register peripherals' memory space
- card reader/writer
- random access storage?
