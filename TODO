TODO, in approximate order:
- reload program after reset?
- "serial" I/O (polling, hacky)
- Add assembler test programs to test as many instructions/address modes as possible
- User guide
    - could publish here
- Interrupt support
  - Timer interrupt?
- add assembler support for reg aliases (IP, SP, FLG)
- gtk front-end
- support .ORG statement
    - multi-segment object files
    - loader for multi-segment
- support strings as static data in assembler (possible now but must be done by hand)
- linker (depends on multi-segment object files)
- card reader/writer
- random access storage?
- live assembler (for gtk version)
