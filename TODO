TODO, in approximate order:
- Logging of printer output
- card reader/writer
- visual improvements for gui (this is more of a continuous task)
    - could publish here
- add assembler support for text, packed and unpacked
- add assembler support for reg aliases (IP, SP, FLG)
- assembler option to dump symbol table
- support .ORG statement
    - multi-segment object files
    - loader for multi-segment
- linker (depends on multi-segment object files)
- serial I/O for terminal
- Interrupt support
  - Timer interrupt?
- random access storage?
- live assembler (for qt version)
- self-hosted assembler
- COBOL-ish compiler (depends on punch card I/O)


Pie in the sky:
- page table support
- kernel/user mode
- direct-access storage
- some sort of OS
