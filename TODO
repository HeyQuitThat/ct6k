TODO, in approximate order:
Short term:
- card reader/writer test programs
    - could publish here

- add assembler support for text, packed and unpacked
- add assembler support for punch card output
- add assembler support for reg aliases (IP, SP, FLG) (nice to have)
- support .ORG statement
- boot loader firmware

- assembler support for include - or - multiple input files
- assembler option to dump symbol table
- multi-segment object files
- loader for multi-segment
- linker (depends on multi-segment object files)

- serial I/O for terminal
- WAIT opcode for interrupt-driven I/O
- Interrupt support
  - Timer interrupt?
- random access storage?
- self-hosted assembler
- COBOL-ish compiler (depends on punch card I/O)


Pie in the sky:
- live assembler (for qt version)
- page table support
- kernel/user mode
- some sort of OS

CONSTANT/FOREVER
- visual improvements for gui (this is more of a continuous task)
